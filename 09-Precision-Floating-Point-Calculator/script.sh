The << notation (the here document) at allows you to
include content from the script and treat it as if
it were typed directly into the input stream.
In this case provides an easy mechanism for handing
commands to the bc program.

In this notation, whatever you put after the << sequence
is what itâ€™ll then seek to match (on a line by itself) to
denote the end of that input stream.
